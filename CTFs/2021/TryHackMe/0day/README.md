I will start by a full scan using Nmap, Dirbuster & Nikto, but I will use webmap to automate them .
We just have 2 open port in this CTF the **22 / SSH** & **80 / HTTP**
I found in nikto that http://10.10.141.238/cgi-bin/test.cgi is vulnerable to shellshock so I used the metasploit exploit 
after that I got a shell 

then I used linux-exploit-suggester and I used this exploit
   Details: http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/717
   Exposure: highly probable
 after compiling and executing this exploit I was root
