# BoilCTF
This is an Intermediate level CTF. I just have enumerate, and I'll be root.

let's first use WebMap to enumerate the website

I found a lot of intersting information. 
```
21/tcp    open  ftp
80/tcp    open  http
10000/tcp open  snet-sensor-mgmt
55007/tcp open  ssh
```

I found that there is an anon login on the ftp, I found that text
*Just wanted to see if you find it. Lol. Remember: Enumeration is the key!*

and we have the joomla but we also have webmin 

Joomla is not vulnerable I used joomscan and I found nothing

but sar2html is vulnerable I just made a reverse shell and am in

and I also found some creds
```
basterd:superduperp@$$
stoner:superduperp@$$no1knows
```
And now I'm logged in 

I found that it's vulnerable to lxd vulnerability a
```
find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
```

and now am root
